# Zabbix
Within this repository, one can discover an abundance of essential commands, valuable tips, and practical scripts relevant to the Zabbix monitoring domain.
**Name**  
The installation process of Zabbix  
  
**Description**  
#Zabbix is a tool used for monitoring IT infrastructure like networks, servers, virtual machines, and cloud services. It is open-source software that collects and displays basic metrics. For more definitions, check out @zabbix or Wikipedia. Zabbix can be installed through multiple methods, but this tutorial will focus on the installation method using Zabbix agents. 
  
**Installation**  
To begin, we need to obtain the Zabbix repository and perform updates on all files.
apt update

    wget https://repo.zabbix.com/zabbix/6.4/ubuntu/pool/main/z/zabbix-release/zabbix-release_6.4-1+ubuntu22.04_all.deb
    dpkg -i zabbix-release_6.4-1+ubuntu22.04_all.deb
    apt update
    
For the second step, we'll require some tools.

    apt install gcc libssh2-1-dev golang make odbc-mariadb unixodbc unixodbc-dev odbcinst mariadb-server mysql-server zabbix-agent2 libxml2-dev pkg-config libsnmp-dev snmp  libopenipmi-dev libevent-dev  libcurl4-openssl-dev libpcre3-dev build-essential libmariadb-dev sudo libxml2-dev snmp libsnmp-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev php-gd php-xml php-bcmath php-mbstring vim libevent-dev libpcre3-dev libxml2-dev libmariadb-dev libopenipmi-dev pkg-config php-ldap -y

  Determine your directory.

    cd /opt
    
Set The environment variable for Golang.

    export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
    
To complete the task, download Zabbix.tar.gz and proceed to extract it in the current directory..

    wget https://cdn.zabbix.com/zabbix/sources/stable/6.4/zabbix-6.4.5.tar.gz
     tar -zxvf zabbix-6.4.5.tar.gz

We require a user specifically for Zabbix. 
***Please note:* 
*This user cannot be used to log into Linux and does not have a user directory. It is solely to use Zabbix.***

    addgroup --system --quiet zabbix 
    adduser --quiet --system --disabled-login --ingroup zabbix --home /var/lib/zabbix --no-create-home zabbix
    mkdir -m u=rwx,g=rwx,o= -p /var/lib/zabbix
    chown -R zabbix:zabbix /var/lib/zabbix
    
It is now time to set up the configuration for Zabbix.
***Please note: 
that it is essential to configure the settings correctly. An error may occur if there are any issues in the previous level.***

    cd zabbix-6.4.5/
    
     ./configure --enable-server --enable-agent --with-mysql --enable-ipv6 --with-unixodbc --with-net-snmp --with-libcurl --with-libxml2 --with-openipmi  --enable-agent2 --with-ssh2  --enable-webservice
     
At this stage, you can proceed with installing Zabbix. However, this installation does not include a user-friendly front end for end-users. 

    make install
    apt update 

Usage  
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.  
  
Support  
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.  
  
Roadmap  
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.  
  
Contributing  
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.  
  
For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.  
  
You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.
